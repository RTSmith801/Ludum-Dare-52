        <h1>Harvester Saloon</h1>

        <h2>Key Learnings:</h2>

            <h3>Main Challenges Faced:</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Integration of 2D Art in a 3D Environment</dt>
                <dd>Utilizing sprite-based art, we aimed to simulate 3D movement. Managing perspectives when the player moves within the bar proved particularly challenging.</dd>

            <h3>Lessons Learned:</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Implementation of Cinemachine Cameras in 3D Spaces</dt>
                <dd>We employed multiple cameras in the project to switch between different scenes, altering the game's atmosphere. This skill has been invaluable and frequently used in subsequent projects.</dd>

            <h3>Approach for Future Iterations:</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Maintaining Faithfulness to the Source Material</dt>
                <dd>While adhering to the original concept, we deviated from the movement mechanics of the original 'Tapper'. This resulted in unintended alterations to the gameplay experience. For future rebuilds, I would retain the original movement mechanics to preserve the intended gameplay.</dd>
